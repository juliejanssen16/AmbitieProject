Ambitie Project 
Julie Janssen 

Idea : 
I want to create a website for my future children's psychologist office/company.
This gives potential clients an introduction to the company and to me as a psychologist. 
It's also a way to reach (more) potential clients. 

Why : 
Because I want to start my own children's psychologist office/company and creating
the website now will be very helpful for the future.
Another reason would be that I'm looking for a challenge that actually tests and 
grows my web development skills. 

Art style :
For the art style I want it to look cartoon-ish and childish to make it appealing to 
parents of kids or even the kids themselves. This might also help with building trust
and a feeling of safety for the clients.
- Inspiration : Yokogama official website
